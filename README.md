* few-shot examples


2. What are the essential components of a well-crafted prompt for an AI model? Provide an example of a basic prompt and explain its elements.
Types of Prompts:

Answers:

- Examples - To indicate the format or shape that you want the model response to be, include one or more pairs of example input and corresponding output that illustrate the pattern you want the generated text to follow
- Instructions - a specific task or instruction you want the model to perform
- Context - external information or additional context that can steer the model to better responses
- Input Data -the input or question that we are interested to find a response for
- Output Indicator - the type or format of the output.

E.g 

What are the two top advantages of using a windows laptop? 

Instruction - Asking for the top advantages 

Context - Window’s laptop is the topic 

Input Data - Benefits of windows laptops

Output Indicator - brief explanation of two advantages. 

Types of prompts:
* Text prompts 
* Code prompts 
* Image prompts 


3. Describe different types of prompts (e.g., open-ended prompts, instructional prompts). How does the type of prompt influence the AI model's response?
Prompt Tuning:

Answers: 

Open-minded prompts:
- Description: Invite expansive responses without specific constraints.
- E.g. Describe the impacts of social media on communication. 

Instructional Prompts: 
- Description: Provide clear directives or tasks for the model to perform.
- E.g. “Summarise the following article in 3 sentences” 

- Explanation of How Prompts Influence Model Outputs: The choice and formulation of prompts directly impact the outputs generated by Al models. Well-crafted prompts can guide models to produce desired responses, while poorly constructed prompts may result in inaccurate or irrelevant outputs.


4. What is prompt tuning, and how does it differ from traditional fine-tuning methods? Provide a scenario where prompt tuning would be advantageous.
Role of Context in Prompts:

Answers: 

Prompt Tuning - Is a technique designed to enhance the performance of a pre-trained language model without altering its core architecture.

Differences: 
* Prompt tuning adjusts how a model responds by changing the input prompts, without altering the model's internal parts. Fine-tuning changes the model’s inner workings by retraining it on new data. 
* Prompt tuning is quicker and less resource-heavy, while fine-tuning is more thorough and requires more time and data. 
* Prompt tuning is great for fast adjustments, whereas fine-tuning is used for major changes.

Scenario:  A company needs to customize an Al customer support chatbot to handle new product inquiries effectively. They want the chatbot to recognize and respond accurately to specific product-related questions without retraining the entire model.

- Advantage: Prompt tuning allows the company to quickly adapt the chatbot by optimizing prompts related to the new product features and questions.This method saves time and resources compared to traditional fine-tuning, which would involve retraining the model on new product-related data.


5. Explain the role of context in designing effective prompts. How can adding or omitting context affect the output of an AI model?
Ethical Considerations in Prompt Engineering:

Answers:

- Context in designing effective prompts clarifies the intent and specifics of the task, guiding the AI to produce relevant, accurate, and aligned responses by reducing ambiguity and improving coherence.
- Adding context to AI prompts leads to more relevant, accurate, and aligned responses, while omitting context can result in vague, misaligned, or inappropriate outputs, reducing the model's effectiveness and potentially leading to ethical issues.

Ethical considerations in prompt engineering include mitigating bias, ensuring transparency, maintaining safety and appropriateness of responses, and supporting user autonomy by providing clear, contextual guidance for AI outputs.


6. What ethical issues should be considered when designing prompts for AI systems? Discuss potential biases and how they can be mitigated.
Evaluation of Prompts:

Answers:

- Bias Amplification: Biased prompts may reinforce existing biases in Al models, leading to unfair or discriminatory outcomes.
- Misinformation: Misleading prompts can result in the generation of inaccurate or deceptive content, spreading misinformation.
- Privacy Concerns: Prompts containing sensitive information may compromise user privacy if not handled securely.

Potential biases: 
* Cultural Bias:  Mitigation:Consider cultural nuances in prompt design and utilize datasets that reflect global diversity. Allow customization of prompts based on cultural preferences.
* Stereotyping Bias: Mitigation: Implement algorithms that detect and avoid stereotypical language or assumptions in responses. Provide context-aware prompts that specify inclusive language guidelines.


7. How can the effectiveness of a prompt be evaluated? Describe some metrics or methods used to assess prompt performance.
Challenges in Prompt Engineering:

Answers:

- To evaluate the quality of a prompt and the results it generates, we can use an approach that considers criteria such as clarity, specificity, impartiality, coherence, relevance, and usefulness of the result.
- Prompt performance can be evaluated using metrics such as response rate, which measures the percentage of responses generated by the prompt. Quality of responses can be assessed through criteria like relevance to the prompt's intent or the accuracy of information provided. User satisfaction surveys or feedback can also gauge how well the prompt met user expectations and needs.


Challenges in Prompt engineering:
* prompt bias 
* Prompt ambiguity 
* Prompt overfitting 


8. Identify and discuss common challenges faced in prompt engineering. How can these challenges be addressed?
